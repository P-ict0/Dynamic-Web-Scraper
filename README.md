# 🌐 Dynamic Web Scraper

💻 **Windows and Linux compatible.** 💻

This is a dynamic web scraper specifically designed for websites that have to wait for certain elements to load (such as AngularJS).
It runs at specified time intervals.
This can be used to monitor when a new element is added to the website instead of having to manually refresh it.

Instead of looking at the source, it waits until all elements are loaded to retrieve the results by using selenium and a Firefox driver.

Whenever a new element is discovered, it will notify you and save it to a file so that it doesn't notify you again for that same element in the future.

# 💡 Use case examples
This is useful, for example to notify you when a certain keyword is found on a website, such as:

- New job on a job board
- New product on an online store
- New article on a blog post
- ...

# ✨ Features

- **Automated Scraping:** Runs at user-defined intervals, extracting data without manual input.
- **Notification System:** Notifies users via Windows notifications when new data is found.
- **Robust Parsing:** Utilizes customizable search strings and regular expressions for data extraction.
